It allows for the creation of custom worflows , which can be triggered by various events , such as pushes to a repository , pull requests , or scheduled events. These workflows can be used for various purposes , including Continious Integration(CI), Continious Deployment (CD) , testing and more."

    "- Continious Integration (CI) and Continious Deployment (CD) are two key practices in modern software development , and Github Actions can facilitate both :\n",
    "- Continious Integration (CI): CI is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Each merge triggers an automated build and testing process to ensure changes do not break the existing functionality. With Github Actions , developers can set up workflows to automatically build and test their code every time they push changes to the repository or create a pull request.\n",
    "- Continious Deployment (CD): CD extends the concept of CI by automating the deployment of code to production environments after it passes all the required tests. Github Actions can be configured to automatically deploy applications to various environments , such as staging or production , once the code passes CI checks. This practice reduces the time between development and deployement , allowing faster delivery of features and updates."

After developing the entire branch(new) what they do is that they will also write test cases , to verify whether the story is working or not.

Once QA team verifies all the bugs , then we go to the next environment i.e. UAT --> its a pre-prod environment (here the QA we again do the testing) and finally when everything works fine they take the UAT environment and directly deploy it in the production environment and this is ur live website or live application which is running in the cloud(with some domian name).\n"

    "## Key Stages\n",
    "- 1. Coding : Here a developer uses an integrated development environment(IDE) -- Eg. VS Code/Or any text editor. We can write in any programming languages. During this stage a developer follows some coding standards , best practices.\n",
    "- 2. Version Control : Like Git --> This will manage the entire codebase. This git tool specifically , it helps u to collaborate (allows multiple developers to collaborate). Bcoz of this collaboration u will be able to quickly , efficiently complete the projects itself.\n",
    "Collaborating : Scenarios like u have overwritten some other developers code. So its necessary to use the version control system.\n",
    "- Here main thing that u should know is probably how to commit , how to create branches , how to push the branch , how to pull the branch , how to resolve the conflict(that happens in ur code).\n",
    "- 3. Code Review : Whenever there is a main branch , whenever a developer creates a new story (this will basically be the new branch itself) and in this particular branch developer A starts working on that particular story and then later on this branch is basically merged(to the main branch) , before this branch is merged it's a good practice that we do some kind of code review. We do code reviews like : Peer Code review , Architect code review (different code reviews happen in a specific team) , the main reason is basically to follow the best standard practices for this particular code review. We will take the feedback on ur code , solve the issues and by this we will be able to improve our code quality.\n",
    "- 4. Testing : Here we are talking about automated testing. How this(Automated Testing) happens specifically in developer workflow ?? There are multiple ways :\n",
    "- First : Unit Testing. Where we write unit test cases.\n",
    "- Second : Integration Testing(it is basically done so that the previous stories/modules that are developed should not break).\n",
    "- Third : Design end to end test cases (just to find whether everything is working fine or not).\n",
    "- Since this automated testing is a part of the entire workflow (the above ways should also get automatically triggered , whenever we try to merge the code to the main branch itsef).\n",
    "- 5. Continious Integration (CI) : Bcoz in a project we have multiple developers , so in every commit of a code we should be reviewing it , building the project , testing the use cases(automated testing). And the developer should also be notified to fix the issues b4 merging .\n",
    "- 6. Continious Deployment (CD) : After the merge is done successfully we deploy it in different different environments/server let's say QA server , dev server ,  UAT , prod --> are the servers we use."

    "- This way they are following some particular workflow before commiting/merging to the main branch.\n",

    "- In CD upon merging the PR(Post request --> basically a event )(Event can be a post/ pull request , whenever a event occurs a workflow gets triggered based on that particular event--> CI/CD workflow) a CD pipeline is triggered. This workflow follows some steps/process. In this workflow a pipeline is basically triggered , upon merging the PR once the merge basically happens a CD pipeline is triggered and this automatically deploys the application to any dev/staging environment for testing.\n",
